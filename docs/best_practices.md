# Injection Moulding Tooling Maintenance Best Practices

Maintaining injection mould tooling after each production run is critical to ensure consistent part quality, minimise downtime, and extend tool life. The following guidelines summarise industry best practices that the Tool Maintenance Management System will support and enforce.

## Post-Run Inspection & Cleaning
- **Initial Visual Inspection:** Examine cavities, cores, runners, and gates for wear, flash, or residue. Document findings with high-resolution photos when anomalies are found.
- **Cleaning:** Remove moulded part residues, vent build-up, and lubricants using approved solvents and non-abrasive brushes. Record cleaning agents used and elapsed time.
- **Cooling Channel Flush:** Circulate descaling agents or clean water to remove mineral deposits. Log flow rates and temperature differentials.
- **Ejector System Check:** Verify ejector pins, lifters, and slides for smooth operation. Lubricate with manufacturer-approved greases and record lubrication points serviced.

## Dimensional & Functional Checks
- Measure critical dimensions against control plans; flag deviations exceeding tolerance bands.
- Inspect surface finish for corrosion, microcracks, or pitting; capture magnified images when possible.
- Validate alignment features (guide pins, bushings) and replace worn components.
- Confirm sensors (thermocouples, cavity pressure) are operational and recalibrated on schedule.

## Shot Count & Life Tracking
- Update shot counts immediately after production. Use automated counters or integrate PLC/OPC-UA data where available.
- Compare cumulative shots to preventative maintenance (PM) triggers. Schedule PM tasks and create action items when thresholds are exceeded.
- Record any rebuilds, component replacements, or engineering changes affecting tool life calculations.

## Failure Reporting & Root Cause Analysis
- Use a standardised failure taxonomy (e.g., cooling issue, flash, short shot, ejector jam, corrosion, dimensional drift).
- Capture failure severity, suspected causes, and impacted part numbers.
- Attach photo evidence highlighting defects or damaged components.
- Assign containment and corrective actions with due dates and responsible owners.

## Storage & Preservation
- Apply rust inhibitors or desiccant packs before storage. Document chemical products used and reapplication intervals.
- Store tools in climate-controlled racks with proper labelling (asset number, status, next run date).
- Track storage location in the system to support quick retrieval.

## Documentation & Compliance
- Maintain digital records for audits: inspection checklists, maintenance logs, calibration certificates, and supplier documentation.
- Enforce electronic sign-offs with technician credentials and timestamps.
- Provide dashboards for KPIs such as tool availability, MTBF, and PM completion rates.

These best practices inform the workflows, validation rules, and reporting capabilities implemented throughout the application.
